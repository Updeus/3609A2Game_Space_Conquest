In my game, space conquest, the user can use w key to move
upwards, s key to move downwards, a key to move to the left,
and d key to move to the right. The player can also press the
space key to receive a speed boost.
The user scores points by destroying the alien ships that spawn
to the left and right of the screen by using the j key to shoot
their gun, or using the k key to shoot missiles that do more
damage.
Note: When the user gets a game over, they should press the enter key, and not the start
button on the menu GUI, as pressing the start button a 2nd time breaks the game.
